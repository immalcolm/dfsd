Validate User Age
Objective: Write a function that checks if a user is eligible to vote (age must be 18 or older).

Instructions:
Define a function named canVote that takes age as a parameter.
If the age is 18 or older, return true; otherwise, return false.

Logical errors in condition checking that exclude boundary values.
