# Guessing Game

**Objective:**
Implement a guessing game using a do-while loop where the user has to guess a predefined number (e.g., 7). The loop should continue until the correct number is guessed.

**Common Mistake:**

Not parsing the prompt input to an integer, which could lead to never exiting the loop if comparing a string to an integer.
These questions and the highlighted common mistakes provide a balanced mix of practice and precaution, enabling learners to not only understand how to use different types of loops but also to be mindful of typical errors that can occur during implementation.
