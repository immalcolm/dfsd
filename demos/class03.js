//basics of JavaScript
// 1. Variables

var jackSick = false; // Is Jack sick? 

//2. Data Types to help us define better 


//how to define a variable
//string --> can use "" or ' '
var pgfm = "Programming Fundamentals" //var => variable 
var pgfm_2 = "Programming Fundamentals 2" //var => variable
//number 
let a = 1;
let b = true;
//test whether two variables are equal
// the issue is when we comparing
// a string vs a number
// JS will try it's best to convert the string 
// best practise usually is to use ===
// strict operator "comparision"

//-> C# int a = 3
//-> C# string b = "3.0"
if (a === b){ 
    console.log("a is equal to b");
}else{
    console.log("a is not equal to b");
}

//if else statements 
/*conditionals -->  
 more than >
 less than < 
 more than or equal to >=
 less than or equal to <=
 equal to ==
 not equal to !=    
// strict equal to ===
// strict not equal to !==
