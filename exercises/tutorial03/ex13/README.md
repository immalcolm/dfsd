# Calculate Circle Area
Objective: Create a function to calculate the area of a circle given the radius.

## Instructions
- Define a function named calculateCircleArea that takes the radius as a parameter.
- Use the formula: Area = 𝜋 × radius^2 to calculate the area.
- Return the area and print the result.

## Common Mistakes:
- Passing the wrong data type to the function.
- Forgetting to square the radius (radius * radius or radius ** 2).
