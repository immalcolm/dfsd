# Exercise 19

Jo and a friend invented a simple game where the player with the highest value of his height (in cm) plus five times his age wins.
Create variables for the heights and ages of two friends and assign them some values

## Calculate their scores
Decide who wins and print the winner to the console. Include the score in the string that you output to the console. Don’t forget that there can be a draw (both players with the same score).

If it is a draw it should print “It’s a draw”

**CHALLENGE:** Add a third player and now decide who wins.
_Hint:_ You will need the && operator to take the decision.
