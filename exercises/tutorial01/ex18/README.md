# Exercise 18: A test of Truths
SHOULD WE GO DOWN TO THE BEACH TODAY?
John, Eve and Adam are thinking about going down to the beach..
They will only go to the beach if the following conditions are met:
- The weather is sunny or the weather is cloudy
- Eve must be going
- It is not a Tuesday
- Eveâ€™s friend Janice is not going
Replace the ????? with your own condition

**Common Problem**: Wrong usage of the || operator

```javascript
let isSunny = false;
let isCloudy = true;
let isEveGoing = true;
let isTuesday = false;
let isJaniceGoing = false;


if ( ???? ) {
  console.log("Going to the beach!");
} else {
  console.log("Not going to the beach!");


}
```
